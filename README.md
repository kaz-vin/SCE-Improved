 ## Contributing to the resource pack
 Anyone is free to submit their own textures and models to be used in the SCE+ pack. However, it must first get accepted by the SCE dev team. All accepted submissions will be acknowledged for their creations in the credits.txt file.
 Here are guidelines to follow for all submissions:
 1. Submissions must fit within Minecraft's default artsyle.
 2. Textures must be 16x16, with exceptions if the texture is for a custom model.
 3. The submission should be wanted by the community or would otherwise improve the gameplay experience of the community.
 4. Submissions should not be unnecessarily large in file size.
 5. With regards to the submission, users of SCE+ should not gain any significant advantage compared to non-users of the pack.
 6. Submissions should not alter the gameplay for users of the pack (eg. different textures for common building blocks). This is to avoid creating environments which looks vastly different from how it looks normally.
 7. Sumissions must work properly with the SCE server resource pack. *Note: This is not SCE+. This is the resource pack that is automatically downloaded and applied when joining the Spifftopia server.*
 
 *Disclaimer: Following all the guidelines does not guarantee that your submission will get accepted by the dev team, it will only increase the chances.*
